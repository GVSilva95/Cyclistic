# Cyclistic
 Final project for Google's data analyst course. 

 This repository contains an analysis conducted as part of the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate offered on Coursera. In this case study, I analyzed data from Cyclist, a fictional bike-sharing company based in Chicago, to identify and understand the key differences between annual members and casual riders.

Using these insights, I developed strategic recommendations that helped the company design a marketing campaign aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, thereby maximizing business growth. While the project guidelines suggested using data from the past 12 months, due to management considerations, I worked with the most recent 6 months of data. All analyses were performed using RStudio.
